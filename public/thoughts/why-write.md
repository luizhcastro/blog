In a world where attention is increasingly **scarce** and everyone is fighting for minutes of it, writing becomes almost a challenge, a taxing process that demands your concentration and discernment regardless of the subject. Don’t take this the wrong way, I’m not talking about a handful of words you draft to sketch an idea and then hand over to your favorite AI to expand. I’m talking about really writing, **bringing to the surface a feeling, an idea, or a thought** that’s making your mind work harder than usual, demanding your full attention and the desire to do it in the **best possible way.**

Writing helps you think better, organizes your thoughts more clearly, and improves your communication across all media, because when you write you want to write for someone, even if that someone is a future version of yourself. Writing well is perhaps the **greatest skill a common person can possess in 2026.** When you combine a rich repertoire with strong communication, it turns you into a far more **interesting** individual in every sense.

And you know the best part of all this?

**Writing is free, and being good at it is entirely trainable.** With just a paper and pen or any device that lets you write or type, you can practice, **express yourself your way, even without an audience, even if it’s just for your own reading.** Over time and with practice, you’ll become better, not just as a writer but as a **person.**

I don’t know if anyone will read this, and I don’t need someone to read it. **This text is a reminder of my beginning, a reminder of why I started writing, and a reminder of why I should never stop.**

I hope that one day this will make me proud.
