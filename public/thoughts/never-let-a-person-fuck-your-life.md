Maybe you’re going through this, and I’m sorry if it triggers you, but **no matter who it is, NEVER let someone fuck your life**.

You don’t need to accept everything just because it’s from a family member, even if it’s a father, mother or brother you owe nothing to anyone. The most precious thing you have in this life is that it is **YOURS**, the choices and consequences must be yours, **always**. Don’t let other people’s decisions ruin your life to the point that you’re broken, whether mentally or in any other way.

If you identify with this, you’re probably in a relationship that doesn’t do you good, whether it’s a family or romantic bond, or even a friendship. Whoever that person is and how significant they may be in your life, know that in the end it will always be you who matters most.

I recently read *The Metamorphosis* by Franz Kafka. In the book the author shows that no matter how much you care and prioritize others, and even if that act is beautiful and a true expression of love, at some point you’ll realize you should have invested all that effort for **yourself**. Loving and being loved is a beautiful feeling, one of the most beautiful emotions in life, but loving yourself is even more important. In the end, we are there for ourselves. When you reach a point in life where you feel you’re no longer **useful to anything or anyone**, you may finally see the importance of having cultivated a life of self‑love.
