I know people who handle their feelings very well. I'm sure you also know someone like that. I don't really like that word, but it's as if these people were truly <span data-tooltip="those damned Instagram influencers who have twisted the teachings of stoicism">*"stoic"*</span>, they know how to keep life and emotions in separate, organized drawers, so that events in one area of their life don’t directly affect other aspects. 

In contrast, there are people like me, for whom life is a true mix of feelings, everything tangled together like a well‑made pasta.

There is a certain **beauty** in this way of living.

People who live in the present and have full self‑awareness, when they encounter moments that bring their emotions to the surface, they experience them truly and genuinely, respecting their own state and not trying to repress them because they think it’s a weakness. On the contrary, some people have the capacity to express it whether in an artistic way, by venting to a trusted friend, or, like I am doing now, writing to themselves.

### What am I looking for? 
**I seek many things:** recognition, to work at what I love, to love, to be loved, to help others, to be present, to live every phase, every feeling, every moment of my life authentically.

**Whatever you do, homie, put your heart into it and stay strong.**
